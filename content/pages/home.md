_AlgoJamSession_ is an interactive digital art installation that explores the concept of traditional Jam Sessions held in New York city from the 30s on, from a futuristic perspective.

The core of the installation is a large screen showing the tune harmony, beside the image of two augmented reality video cameras.

The song is an original piece synthesized in real-time, containing an algorithm that generates melodies from the motion detection cameras.

The same way musicians improvise over Jazz standards, visitors can improvise over rhythm and harmony using only their body.

The installation contains a set of moving lights, LEDs and smoke machines orchestrated by the song algorithm, allowing to create a truly immersive environment.
