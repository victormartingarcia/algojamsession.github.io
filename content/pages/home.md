AlgoJamSession is a software package that allows you to create improvised music using only your body.

This _improvised_ music is generated algoritmically, depending on the position of the _musicians_ in front of a camera.


It started as a technological-artistic project for creating an interactive installation based on augmented reality, where kids and adults alike could have some fun while experimenting with sound.

The core of this project is the excellent live coding music synth [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi). Please see [MUSIC-GENERATION section](docs/MUSIC-GENERATION.md) to learn more about the internals of AlgoJamSession.
